##### hosting department needs benefits of cloud computing (automation & process optimization, standardization, â€¦ )

##### cloud software that is/become more than IaaS, that can be use by other departments like development

We think, OpenStack is the best base for Pixelpark as a full-service agency

##### Why high available ?

### We provide our customers service level agreement with high availability up to 99,99 %.
